(a) 
Consider a file file1.txt and a second file file2.txt created using the command
Only one.
(b) 
The output is "Hello there".
(c)
Only one.
(d) The output is "No such file or directory"
In question 1b, it creates a hardlink. The hardlink preserves the contents of the file. When the original file is deleted, you can still access content of the file by using hard link. 
However, the ln -s makes a symbolic link which only points to the original files. It does not contain contents. When the original file is removed, the link would become useless.
(e) No. Hard links cannot be created for directories.
