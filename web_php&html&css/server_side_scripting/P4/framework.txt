Add a new table: login table. It has four attributes: loginID(int4,not null, auto increasing,pk), UserID(int 4, not null,fk), username (varchar(255),not null), and password (varchar(255),notnull ). This table store user's information that is used to log in.

A description of the database:
The Chat use MySql to read, store, insert, search data. There are three tables: user, follow, and post. The user table stores The user table stores UserID (primary key), Name, and Profile. The following table stores FollowingID, User's ID, and FollowingUser's ID. This table shows one's followers and users he/she is following. It use FollowingID as primary key and other two attributes are foreign key  which references to user table's primary key. The Posts stores PostID(primary key), UserID(foreign key which references to the user table's UserID), Date(date of post texts), and Post(Post texts). 

A description of how you implement the search:
There is a search function which take in keyword and search. The function selects all posts which are related to the account user(name of the user, his/her followers, and users who he/she is following or posts posted by the user, his/her followers, and users who he/she is following). It first join posts and user table by userId to get all users' name their posts. Then using it to left join the table which contains following users(select all users whose user is 1) and left join the table which contains follower users(select all users whose followingUser is 1). Afterwards, select posts which FollowingUser in not null, or User(Follower) is not null or the userid is 1 and has content like the search keyword in name, data, or posts. At last use str_ireplace() function to replace searched keywords with bolded font without case senstive and return the content.

This site is a content management system which shows users' own chats, his or her followers' chats and those whom he or she is following. It allows users to create, search chats. Users can also review what they posted.
 
I used Bootstrap. (Getbootstrap.com, 2018) to design the site. I used its responsive layout to enable this site to adapt to screen. I also used responsive images, badge, card, forms, list group, navs, nav, nav bar and, etc. With those features, I designed this site a responsive one. 


This site is composed of four PHP files. They are Homepage, MyChats, Follow, Search pages.
Every page has a navigation bar which has two links that direct to the home page and MyChats page. There are a search bar and a chat button in the navigation bar. 


The first one is the Homepage. It displays the home page for the site. Including the navigation bar, it has a head which is consist of the icon, name, and a slogan. In the body, it has a left pad and contains the account owner¡¯s head picture and username. There are three links under them. They are Chats, Following, and Followers. Chats is linked to what the account owners¡¯ personal page. It will display what he or she has posted and a self-description.  On the right panel, there is a chat pad where the user can create new chats. The following content is New Chats where shows all chats posted by those whom the user is following. The chat can be a line of text, a text with a picture or a picture only. In the head of the posted chat, it shows the username, user head image, date, and time.


The second one is search page which shares the same template with the Homepage except the heading of the main content is what users have inputted in the search bar. 


The third one is MyChats. It¡¯s a place hold information of each users' account and what he or she has posted. Beneath the navigation bar, the head is the account owner's head picture and username. In the user profile, it also shows the owner or users' short descriptions while it has those three links for chats, following, and followers. It is the template for followers and following users. People who have accounts will share the same template except for personal contents like the user's head picture, username, description, followers, and followings will be different. Contents in chats panel are also different. The page title and the picture, as well as name, will change according to if the link is from a Following or Follower. 


The final one is the Follow template. It is the template to show followers or following users. It shares most of the contents of the Home page except that in the main panel, the content is followers or following users¡¯ name list.
